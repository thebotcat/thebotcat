finish checking slash commands
finish checking settings command, kick, ban, unban, emoterole, all voice and music commands
  kick, ban, unban use confirm before ban, but reacting is no longer working
fix mentions especially on troll commands

voice commands need fixing

finish migrating to o.regCmdResp

fix anything that uses o.guild, o.channel, o.author, o.member in regular commands not working, basically look closely at differences between o in messageCreate and interactionCreate
  specifically, bug with settings badwords modify

finish fixing slash command support

make purge command work in dms
make all commands reply not just content (?)
rename hack command to hack-old and make hack command more dynamic
reorder arguments in settings badwords
move all miscellaneous common functions into misc.js
parse_cmd_args "-a" with no argument after should add null to kwargs
make bitrate command accept channel ids directly pasted in and search by channel name as text
  also join command
make math.js an npm package instead of included in source code
content commands that send an embed with a gif can just send gif
  content and content2 should be identical for non slash

make pseudo tagscript implementation in common and use it
  ts('{e}', {e:4})
  idea: double up braces {{e}} to escape them
